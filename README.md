# RandomPasswordGen
Random Password Generator

Generates four random 9-character passwords (using alphanumerics and ten symbols !@#$%^&*?+).

Made as an exercise in pulling from an array and randomizing output into HTML.

Future implementation/changes include "click to copy password" button, ability to change number of characters 
generated, and cleaner codebase in general.
